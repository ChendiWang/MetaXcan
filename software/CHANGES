Version 0.3.3
    * Refactor towards new feature development
    * Changed parameter names for MetaXcan scripts, to be more explicit about effect allele, and compressed argument meaning.
    * Expanded documentation with windows support example.
Version 0.3.2
    * Fixed script that generates variances from Im Lab's dosage files.
    * Now M03_betas.py can work on inputs without specifying any transcriptome model. This will just produce the input GWAS data in a different format.
    * Minor fix to be more lenient on input covariances.
Version 0.3.1
    * Various changes to MetaMany.py: 
        * Better flexibility for database organization. 
        * Result files are now named GWAS-TISSUE to make them easier to identify
        * Betas are stored inside the output directory 
Version 0.3
    * New Transcriptome Model (Weight DBs) format support. Formalized Metaxcan output handling, added new fields to output (effect size, model prediction qvalue, etc)
Version 0.2.6
	* Fixed bug in --zscore_column option data handling
Version 0.2.5
	* Made some file handling errors more verbous. Added unit test for GWAS processing logic.
Version 0.2.4
	* Some input bug fixes. Added "MetaMany.py", a convenience for running MetaXcan with different tissue models on a single command.
Version 0.2.3
	* Added support for some GWAS input files. Improved unit test coverage.
Version 0.2.1
	* added option to zscores for saving ensembl versions
Version 0.2
	* Changed covariance format and runtime flag
